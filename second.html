        <h1>My Favorite Cities</h1>
        <p>I love urban spaces. I used to travel with my grandfather as a child and we visited nearly every large city across the United States. If you were going to allow me only to pick one, it would have to be the city I was born in…Los Angeles. Many would already ask “why?” Unless you’ve lived there and breathed in the air (no not the smog) then you know what I’m talking about. The whole culture of the city is fluid and fast. I love it.</p>
